## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, working under the supervision of Prof. John Novembre. My research focuses on statistical methods development and ancestry simulations in population genetics. I completed my Ph.D. in Statistical Population Genetics at McGill University under the guidance of Prof. Simon Gravel.

My research interests include evolutionary biology, spatial distribution of genetic variation, and data visualization.
